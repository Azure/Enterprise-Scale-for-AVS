### General 

* Description: This module either creates a new vwan resource or looks up an existing VWAN resource and returns the resource ID by leveraging an existence flag. This is used as part of AVS VWAN greenfield and brownfield scenarios involving VWAN hubs.

* The module leverages variables for naming and common values to be modified as part of the deployment.

* A tfvars template file has been included for use if implementing this module as a standalone deployment.

# Design phase #2: Connectivity with Azure Virtual Networks
Azure VMware Solution private clouds connect to Azure VNets through managed ExpressRoute circuits (see section [What is the role played by ExpressRoute](avs-networking-basics.md#what-is-the-role-played-by-expressroute) for more details). In hub and spoke Azure networks (including those based on Virtual WAN), connecting a private cloud's managed circuit to an ExpressRoute Gateway in the hub VNet (or Virtual WAN hub) provides layer-3 connectivity with the private cloud. However, enforcing security policies (selectively allowing or denying connections between resources in Azure VNets and virtual machines running in the private cloud, or between resources in Azure VNets and the private cloud's management endpoints) is often a requirement. While both Azure VNets and vSphere/NSX-T provide native constructs for network segmentation, firewall solutions deployed as NVAs in Azure VNets are often the preferred option in enterprise-scale environments. Design Phase #2 focuses on the VNet configuration that allows routing traffic between private clouds and Azure VNets through custom next hops, such as firewall NVAs.

Design Phase #2 depends on the option selected in selected in [Design Phase #1](onprem-connectivity.md) for on-premises connectivity. In fact, the  managed ExpressRoute circuit that connects a private cloud to an Azure VNet may also play a role in connectivity with on-premises sites. This is the case when [Transit over ExpressRoute Private peering](onprem-connectivity.md#transit-over-expressroute-private-peering) is chosen in Design Phase #1, as shown in the flow chart below.

*Design Phase #2: Connectivity with Azure VNets based on the option connectivity with on-premises sites chosen in Design Phase #1.*

## Connectivity with Azure VNets when "Transit over ExpressRoute Private Peering" is used for on-prem traffic 
When [Transit over ExpressRoute Private Peering](onprem-connectivity.md#transit-over-expressroute-private-peering) is used for connectivity with on-premises sites, traffic is routed through NVAs (typically, Azure Firewall or third-party firewall solutions) in the hub VNet . Traffic from on-premises sites enters the Azure VNet through the ExpressRoute gateway (connected to the customer-owned circuit) and is routed to the firewall NVA. After inspection, it is forwarded (if not dropped by the firewall) to the private cloud through the managed ExpressRoute circuit. In the opposite direction, traffic from the private cloud enters the hub VNet or the auxiliary VNet (depending on the implementation option, [single VNet](onprem-connectivity.md#single-vnet) or [auxiliary VNet](onprem-connectivity.md#auxiliary-vnet), chosen in Design Phase #1) through the ExpressRoute gateway (connected to the managed circuit) and gets routed to the firewall NVA. After inspection, it is forwarded (if not dropped by the firewall) to the on-premises destination through the customer-owned ExpressRoute circuit. Both the "single VNet" and the "auxiliary VNet" options include routing configuration that causes all traffic coming from a private cloud to be forwarded to the firewall NVAs in the hub VNet, irrespective of its destination (Azure VNet or on-premises sites). Therefore, firewall inspection for traffic between private clouds and Azure VNets does not require additional routing configuration. Of course, firewall rules to allow/drop connections between virtual machines running in the private cloud and Azure resources must be added to firewall policy. 

## Connectivity with Azure VNets when ExpressRoute Global Reach is used for on-premises traffic
When [ExpressRoute Global Reach](onprem-connectivity.md#expressroute-global-reach) is used for connectivity with on-premises sites, the ExpressRoute gateway connection between the hub VNet and the private cloud only carries traffic destined to Azure resources. In order to route this traffic through a firewall device, the following configuration is required:
- In traditional hub and spoke networks, User-Defined Routes (UDRs) must be added to the hub VNet's GatewaySubnet for all destinations (IP prefixes) in Azure that must be reached through the NVAs. The next hop IP address for the UDRs is the firewall's VIP (the firewall's private IP address when Azure Firewall is used).
- In hub and spoke networks based on Virtual WAN with hub-integrated NVAs (Azure Firewall or supported 3rd party security solutions), custom static routes must be added to the Virtual WAN hub's default route table for each set of destinations (IP prefixes) that must be reached through the NVAs from Azure VMware Solution. For each such UDR, the next hop must be the Firewall/NVA's VIP. Alternatively, [Azure Virtual WAN Routing Intent/Routing Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-wan/how-to-routing-policies) can be activated and configured on secured Virtual WAN Hubs.

## Connectivity with Azure VNets when IPSec VPNs are used for on-premises traffic
When [IPSec VPNs](onprem-connectivity.md#ipsec-vpns) are used for connectivity with on-premises sites, additional routing configuration is required to route connections between a private cloud and resources in Azure VNets through firewall NVAs:    
- In traditional hub and spoke networks, User-Defined Routes (UDRs) must be added to the hub VNet's GatewaySubnet for all destinations (IP prefixes) in Azure that must be reached through the NVAs. The next hop IP address for the UDRs is the firewall's VIP (the firewall's private IP address when Azure Firewall is used).
- In hub and spoke networks based on Virtual WAN with hub-integrated NVAs (Azure Firewall or supported 3rd party security solutions), custom static routes must be added to the Virtual WAN hub's default route table for each set of destinations (IP prefixes) that must be reached through the NVAs from Azure VMware Solution. For each such UDR, the next hop must be the Firewall/NVA's VIP. Alternatively, [Azure Virtual WAN Routing Intent/Routing Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-wan/how-to-routing-policies) can be activated and configured on secured Virtual WAN Hubs.

# HCX Installation Preparation

## System Requirements

### Virtual Hardware Requirements for HCX Appliances

Please visit [Virtual Hardware Requirements for HCX Appliances](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.3/hcx-user-guide/GUID-D64901F4-6AB4-4820-9303-27927648A34D.html).

### Software Version Requirements

For a complete list of Software Requirements for HCX, please visit [VMware Official Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.3/hcx-user-guide/GUID-54E5293B-8707-4D29-BFE8-EE63539CC49B.html).

### Network Port and Protocol Requirements

HCX deployments require setting various ports for communication between services on the HCX appliance itself and between HCX pairs at the source and destination sites.

For a complete list of network port and protocol requirements, see [VMware Ports and Protocols](https://ports.esp.vmware.com/home/VMware-HCX).

### Network Underlay Minimum Requirements

Please visit [Network Underlay Minimum Requirements](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.3/hcx-user-guide/GUID-8128EB85-4E3F-4E0C-A32C-4F9B15DACC6D.html).

HCX has network underlay minimums for HCX Migration and disaster recovery operations. HCX operations with lesser than the minimum values are not officially supported.

The values provided are the minimums for individual operations at minimum performance.

- Minimizing latency, loss, jitter results in improved migration performance outcomes.
- Parallel HCX operations (migration and extension) result in increased bandwidth requirements.

### User Account and Role Requirements

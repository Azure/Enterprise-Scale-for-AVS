# Azure VMware Solution Well-Architected Framework: Operational Excellence

The purpose of this section is to build out the operating model for the Azure VMware Solution and the applications inside the SDDC. 

## Management & Monitoring 

It's essential to know how the workload in the SDDC is doing. Similar to how you would monitor things such as CPU usage, OS logs, and security alerts, to name a few, these same elements are monitored in the SDDC. The key difference is that you can now leverage cloud-native plus existing VMware tools into your operating model. Tools include but are not limited to enabling VMware VROP's, installing Azure Monitor agents, and any third party monitoring/reporting tool used today on-prem.

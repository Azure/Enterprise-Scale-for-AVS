# Azure VMware Solution Well-Architected Framework: Operational Procedures

This section aims to build the operating model for the Azure VMware Solution, and the applications inside the Software Defined Datacenter (SDDC). Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are documented processes for managing a workload. Each AVS workload should have SOPs to govern operations. Without SOPs, teams drift from management best practices, so we recommend a continuous cycle of assessment and health checks for your AVS workload.

## Secure Virtual WAN with Route-Intent for Azure VMware Solution
 A security solution such as Azure Firewall, a third-party Network Virtual Appliance (NVA), or SaaS solution in the Virtual WAN hub effectively converts the hub to a Secure Virtual WAN hub. A Secure Virtual WAN hub is a requirement for configuring Routing-Intent. Routing-Intent streamlines the routing/security design of the secure hub, by driving all private and internet traffic to the hub security solution. This improves the security breadth and conducts traffic inspection for all traffic transiting through the secure hub, including Azure VMware Solution. 


The document assumes readers have a basic understanding of Virtual WAN and Secure Virtual WAN with Routing Intent.

## Secure Virtual WAN with Route-Intent for Azure VMware Solution designs 
Secure Virtual WAN with Routing Intent provides the capability to send all Internet traffic and Private network traffic (RFC 1918) to a security solution like Azure Firewall, a third-party Network Virtual Appliance (NVA), or SaaS solution. With Azure VMware Solution, Secure Virtual WAN with Route-Intent supports both Single-Region and Dual-Region designs.  

### Single-Region design    
The single-region design allows network traffic inspection within the Virtual Hub security solution to and from Azure VMware Solution, which improves security and simplifies network management. This design also prepares for future deployments of another Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud in a different region with a dual-region design. Enabling Route-Intent in a Single Region hub helps scale to a dual-hub region design in the future more conveniently. This design supports configurations with or without Global Reach.

### Dual-Region/Dual-Hub design  
The dual-region design allows network traffic inspection on both Virtual Hub security solutions. This covers traffic to and from Azure VMware Solution and across Azure VMware Solution private clouds in different regions. Routing-intent must be enabled on both regional hubs to allow traffic to pass through both hub security solutions. The dual-region design with routing-intent improves security and simplifies network management across regions. This design works with or without Global Reach.
![Diagram of Dual-Region High Level Design](./media/dual-region-virtual-wan-high-level-design.png)

## ExpressRoute Global Reach deployment options  
Global Reach establishes a direct logical link via the Microsoft backbone, connecting Azure VMware Solution to On-Premises or regional Azure VMware Solution Private Clouds.

### With Global Reach  
When Global Reach is deployed, traffic between the Global Reach sites bypasses the Secure Virtual WAN Hub Firewall. This means that the Secure Virtual WAN Hub firewall will not inspect any Global Reach traffic that travels between the Azure VMware Solution and the On-Premises, or between the Azure VMware Solution Private Clouds in different regions. For example, the diagram below shows how traffic between Azure VMware Solution and on-premises uses the Global Reach connection labeled as “A” to communicate. This traffic does not transit the hub firewall because of the Global Reach connection "A". For optimal security between Global Reach sites, traffic inspection must be completed within the Azure VMware Solution environment’s NSX-T or an on-premises firewall.

 A benefit of using Global Reach that it simplifies the design with a direct logical connection between Azure VMware Solution and On-Premises or regional Azure VMware Solution private clouds. This eases troubleshooting traffic between Global Reach sites and eliminates the concern of throughput limitations at the Secure Virtual WAN. The drawback is that it prevents the inspection of traffic between regional Azure VMware Solution private clouds and On-Premises or within Azure VMware Solution Private Clouds using the Secure Virtual Hub security solution.

![Diagram of Global Reach Example](./media/single-region-virtual-wan-with-globalreach-1.png)

### Without Global Reach  
It’s crucial to note that unless the situation falls into the following two categories below, it’s strongly recommended to consistently use Global Reach. A benefit of not using Global Reach is that all the traffic on the Secure Virtual WAN hub security solution between Azure VMware Solution and the on-premises or regional Azure VMware Solution private clouds can be inspected. However, the throughput limitations at the Secure Virtual WAN hub also need to be considered. A drawback of not using Global Reach is that it increases the complexity of the design.

**Inspect traffic between Azure VMware Solution and On-Premises or within Azure VMware Solution Private Clouds using the Virtual Hub Firewall.**   
This use case is best when there is a security requirement to inspect traffic between Azure VMware Solution and On-Premises, or between regional Azure VMware Solution Private Clouds on the Virtual Hub Firewall. 
   
**Global Reach unavailability in the region**   
Connectivity between ExpressRoute connections, whether between Azure VMware Solution and on-premises or among regional Azure VMware Solution private clouds, can be established with Route-Intent when Global Reach is unavailable in a region. By default, Secure Virtual Hubs do not support ExpressRoute to ExpressRoute transitivity. To enable this transitivity, a support ticket needs to be initiated. -See [ExpressRoute Global Reach Availability](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-global-reach#availability)

 ## Single and Dual Regions with Global Reach Enabled and Disabled
 
### Single-region design with Global Reach 
When using single-region with Global Reach, the secure hub routes all private and internet traffic through a security solution, such as Azure Firewall, a third-party NVA, or a SaaS solution. This is done by using Routing-Intent. However, Global Reach traffic between Azure VMware Solution and on-premises bypasses the hub firewall as shown below on Global Reach connection “A”. Therefore, you need to inspect this Global Reach traffic with NSX-T in Azure VMware Solution or a firewall on-premises for better security across Global Reach sites.

See the table below for the traffic flows that the Secured Virtual Hub inspects with this design.

**Traffic Inspection**

Traffic flow to and from Azure VMware Solution
| Location 1 |   Direction |  Location 2 | Traffic Inspected on Secure Virtual WAN hub firewall?  
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---|
| Azure VMware Solution   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Virtual Networks |  Yes 
| Azure VMware Solution   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Internet |  Yes 
| Azure VMware Solution   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| on-premises |  No 

Traffic flow to and from Virtual Networks
| Location 1 |   Direction |  Location 2 | Traffic Inspected on Secure Virtual WAN hub firewall?  
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---|
| Virtual Networks   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| on-premises |  Yes 
| Virtual Networks   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Internet |  Yes 
| Virtual Networks   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Virtual Networks |  Yes

### Single-region design without Global Reach
When using single-region without Global Reach, the secure hub routes all private and internet traffic through a security solution, such as Azure Firewall, a third-party NVA, or a SaaS solution. This is done by using Routing-Intent. With this design, traffic between Azure VMware Solution and on-premises transits the hub firewall for inspection. As mentioned earlier, Secure Virtual Hubs do not support ExpressRoute to ExpressRoute transitivity by default. To enable this transitivity, a support ticket needs to be initiated. Once the support ticket has been fulfilled, the secure hub will advertise the default RFC 1918 addresses to Azure VMware Solution and to on-premises. When using Routing-Intent from on-premises, you cannot advertise the exact default RFC 1918 address prefixes (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) back to Azure. Instead, you must always advertise more specific routes.

See the table below for the traffic flows that the Secured Virtual Hub inspects with this design.

**Traffic Inspection**

Traffic flow to and from Azure VMware Solution
| Location 1 |   Direction |  Location 2 | Traffic Inspected on Secure Virtual WAN hub firewall?  
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---|
| Azure VMware Solution   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Virtual Networks |  Yes 
| Azure VMware Solution   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Internet |  Yes 
| Azure VMware Solution   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| on-premises |  Yes 

Traffic flow to and from Virtual Networks
| Location 1 |   Direction |  Location 2 | Traffic Inspected on Secure Virtual WAN hub firewall?  
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---|
| Virtual Networks   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| on-premises |  Yes 
| Virtual Networks   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Internet |  Yes 
| Virtual Networks   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Virtual Networks |  Yes

### Dual-region design with Global Reach 
Using dual-region with Global Reach, you deploy two secure hubs in different regions of your Virtual WAN. You also deploy two Azure VMware Solution private clouds in different regions. You cross connect both Azure VMware Solution private clouds and on-premises to each regional hub via ExpressRoute for redundancy (see connections “E”, “D” and “F”). All private and internet traffic will be routed through a security solution (such as Azure Firewall, a third-party NVA, or a SaaS solution) on both secure hubs using Routing-Intent. This lets you transit traffic across the inter-hub link and inspect it on both Hub firewalls for additional security. However, Global Reach traffic between the Azure VMware Solution private clouds, or between the Azure VMware Solution private clouds and on-premises, bypasses the two hub firewalls (see connections “A”, “B” and “C”). You need to inspect this traffic with NSX-T in Azure VMware Solution or a firewall on-premises for better security across Global Reach sites.

![Diagram of Dual-Region with Global Reach Azure VMware Solution Scenario](./media/dual-region-virtual-wan-with-globalreach-1.png)

See the table below for the traffic flows that the Secured Virtual Hub inspects with this design.

**Traffic Inspection**

| Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud Region 1   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Virtual Network 2 |  Yes, via the Hub 1 and Hub 2 firewalls
| Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud Region 1   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Internet |  Yes, via the Hub 1 firewall  
| Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud Region 1   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| on-premises |  No

| Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud Region 2   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Virtual Network 1 |  Yes, via the Hub 2 firewall
| Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud Region 2   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Virtual Network 2 |  Yes, via the Hub 1 and Hub 2 firewalls
| Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud Region 2   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Internet |  Yes, via the Hub 2 firewall  
| Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud Region 2   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| on-premises |  No 

Traffic flow to and from Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud Region 1 and Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud Region 2
| Location 1 |   Direction |  Location 2 | Traffic Inspected on Secure Virtual WAN hub firewall?  
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---|
| Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud Region 1   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud Region 2 |  No

Traffic flow to and from Virtual Networks
| Location 1 |   Direction |  Location 2 | Traffic Inspected on Secure Virtual WAN hub firewall?  
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---|
| Virtual Network 1   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| on-premises |  Yes, via the Hub 1 firewall  
| Virtual Network 1   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Internet |  Yes, via the Hub 1 firewall 
| Virtual Network 1  | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Virtual Network 2 |  Yes, via the Hub 1 and Hub 2 firewalls 
| Virtual Network 2   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| on-premises |  Yes, via the Hub 2 firewall  
| Virtual Network 2   | &#8594;<br>&#8592;| Internet |  Yes, via the Hub 2 firewall  


### Dual-region design without Global Reach 
Using dual-region without Global Reach, you deploy two secure hubs in different regions of your Virtual WAN. You also deploy two Azure VMware Solution private clouds in different regions. You cross connect both Azure VMware Solution private clouds and on-premises to each regional hub via ExpressRoute for redundancy (see connections “E”, “D” and “F”). All private and internet traffic will be routed through a security solution (such as Azure Firewall, a third-party NVA, or a SaaS solution) on both secure hubs using Routing-Intent. This lets you transit traffic across the inter-hub link and inspect it on both Hub firewalls for additional security. When using Routing-Intent from on-premises, you cannot advertise the exact default RFC 1918 address prefixes (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) back to Azure. Instead, you must always advertise more specific routes. Since Global Reach is not in use, the traffic between the Azure VMware Solution private clouds, or between the Azure VMware Solution private clouds and on-premises, is routed through the hubs, transiting the hub firewalls.
